# Angular Google Maps sandbox

Little sandbox to try some libraries and technologies.

- Angular Google Maps
- Angular Material
- Responsive design
- Progressive Web App features
- NgRx
- IndexedDB browser storage

### Notes

/src/environments is gitignored in this repo, because it contains Maps API key.
My local environments.ts looks like:

    export const environment = {
      production: false,
      mapApiKey: '******************************',
    };
